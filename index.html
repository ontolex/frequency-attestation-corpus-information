       This document describes the <em>module for frequency, attestation and corpus information</em> of the Lexicon Model for Ontologies (<em>lemon</em>) as a result of the work of the Ontology Lexica community group (OntoLex). The module is targeted at complementing dictionaries and other linguistic resources containing lexicographic data with a vocabulary to express
	   <ul>
	   <li> corpus-derived statistics (frequency and cooccurrence information, collocations),</li>
	   <li> pointers from lexical resources to corpora and other collections of text (attestations),</li>
	   <li> the annotation of corpora and other language resources with lexical information (lemmatization against a dictionary), and</li>
	   <li> distributional semantics (collocation vectors, word embeddings, sense embeddings, concept embeddings).</li>
	   </ul>
	   The module tackles use cases in corpus-based lexicography, corpus linguistics and natural language processing, and operates in combination with the <em>lemon</em> core module, referred to as <em>OntoLex</em>, as well as with other <em>lemon</em> modules.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

	  <section>
	  <h3> Background and Motivation </h3>
      <p> The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/"><em>lemon</em> model</a> provides a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/#core">core</a> vocabulary (OntoLex) to represent <em>linguistic information</em> associated to ontology and vocabulary elements. The model follows the principle of <em>semantics by reference</em> in the sense that the semantics of a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/#LexicalEntry">lexical entry</a> is expressed by reference to an individual, class or property defined in an ontology. </p>
	  
	  <p> The current version of <em>lemon</em> (as an outcome of the OntoLex group, sometimes referred as OntoLex-lemon in the literature) as well as its previous version (<a href="https://lemon-model.net/">lemon</a> [<cite><a href="#bib-lemon_paper">1</a></cite>]) have been increasingly used in the context of dictionaries and lexicographical data to convert existent lexicographic information into the standards and formats of the Semantic Web. In consequence, a designated <em>lemon</em> <a href="">module for lexicography</a> (<em>lexicog</em>) has been designed, with applications in monolingual [<cite><a href="#bib-klimek-kdict">2</a></cite>], bilingual [<cite><a href="#bib-gracia-apertium">3</a></cite>], and multilingual [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-kdict">4</a></cite>] dictionaries, as well as diachronic [<cite><a href="#bib-kahn-diachronic">5</a></cite>], dialectal [<cite><a href="#bib-declerck-dialectal">6</a></cite>], and etymological ones [<cite><a href="#bib-abromeit-etymological">7</a></cite>], among others.
	  This module is partially motivated by requirements of corpus-based lexicography (frequency and collocation information) and digital philology (linking lexical resources with corpus data).</p>
	  
	  <p> A second motivation for a <em>lemon</em> model for corpus-based information comes from natural language processing. With the rise of distributional semantics since the early 1990s, lexical semantics have been complemented by corpus-based co-occurrence statistics (KEYNESS-REFERENCE???), collocation vectors (Schütze 1993), word embeddings (Collobert et al. 2012) and sense embeddings (??? and Schütze, 2017). With the proposed module, <em>lemon</em> can serve as a community standard to encode, store and exchange vector representations (embeddings) along with the lexical concepts, senses, lemmas or words that they represent. The processing of word embeddings is beyond the scope of this module. Embeddings are thus represented as literals ("BLOB").</p>
	  
	  <p> The added value of using linked data technologies to represent such information is an increased level of interoperability and integration between different types of lexical resources, the textual data they pertain to, as well as distributional representations of words, lexical senses and lexical concepts. Creating a <em>lemon</em> module in the OntoLex CG is a suitable means for establishing a vocabulary on a broad consensus that takes into account all use cases identified above in an adequate fashion.	 
	<!--	From lexicog:  
	<p> After analysing the literature, the proposers of this module perceived an obvious need for reaching some agreement that allows for a better and more inter-operable migration of existing dictionaries into linked data [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-module">10</a></cite>]. For illustration, the OGL ontology [<cite><a href="#bib-parvizi-oxford">11</a></cite>] has its own notion of dictionary entry  materialised in the <tt>ogl:Entry</tt> class, while in [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-kdict">4</a></cite>] the ad-hoc  <tt>kd:dictionaryEntry</tt> relation was introduced in the conversion of the KD Multilingual Global Series dictionaries, i.e, different researchers introduced their own modelling solutions to account for similar notions. Being interoperability a key issue in linked data technologies, building a common space in which these concepts can be agreed on and commonly defined comes as a logical step.--> 
	The OntoLex community is the natural forum to accomplish this for several reasons: </p>

	   <ol>
		<li> The extended use of <em>lemon</em> to support digital lexicography,
		<li> the improved application and applicabiltiy of <em>lemon</em> in natural language processing,
		<li> the coming together of the lexicography, AI and human language technology communities, resp. resources, and
		<li> the possibility of reusing already available mechanisms in <em>lemon</em>, preventing researchers from "re-inventing the wheel",
	   </ol>

	  </section>
	  
	  <section> 
	  <h3> Aim and Scope </h3>

	  <p>
		The goal of this module is to complement <em>lemon</em> core elements with a vocabulary layer to represent lexicographical and semantic information derived from or defined with reference to corpora in a way that (a) <i>generalizes</i> over use cases from digital lexicography, natural language processing, artificial intelligence, computational philology and corpus linguistics, that (b) facilitates <i>exchange, storage and re-usability</i> of such data along with lexical information, 
		and that (c) <i>minimizes information loss</i>.
	  </p>

	<p> The scope of the model is three-fold:
		<ol>
			<li> extending the <em>OntoLex-lexicog</em> model with corpus information to support existing challenges in corpus-driven lexicography,</li>
			<li> modelling <em>existing</em> lexical and distributional-semantic resources (corpus-based dictionaries, collocation dictionaries, embeddings) as linked data, to allow their conjoint publication and inter-operation by Semantic Web standards, and
			<li> providing a conceptual / abstract model of relevant concepts in distributional semantics that facilitates building linked data-based applications that consume and combine both lexical and distributional information.
		</ol>
	
	<div class="note"><p>
		<em>Corpus</em> as used throughout this document is understood in its traditional, broader sense as a structured data collection -- or material suitable for being included into such a collection. 
		We do not intend to limit the use of the term to corpora in a linguistic or NLP sense. Language resources of any kind (web documents, dictionaries, plain text, unannotated corpora, etc.) are considered "corpus data" and a collection of such information as a "corpus" in this sense. Any information drawn from or pertaining to such information is considered "corpus-based".
	</p>
	</div>
	
	<!--
	lexicog:
	<div class="note"><p>
	In terms of applying the module, we propose the following best practice or "rule of thumb" ... :
		<ol>
			<li> As long as the entities in OntoLex and the other  <em>lemon</em> modules, together with those of catalogues of linguistic categories (e.g. LexInfo), suffice to represent the information encoded in the lexicographic resource (e.g., lexical entry, part of speech, translation, ...), the OntoLex lexicography module should not be instantiated.
			<li> In case that there is some lexicographic information that cannot be modelled by using either OntoLex or any of the other <em>lemon</em> modules (e.g., to denote sense ordering), then the model should be instantiated but avoiding duplicities and keeping extra information to the minimum.
		</ol>
	The reason behind this is that this module adds some complexity by providing additional description capabilities to the purely lexical description accounted by OntoLex. If this information is not needed for a specific conversion, i.e, if the lexicographical view is not key, reusing <em>lemon</em> would allow to keep the representation simpler but still sufficient.

	  <h3> ontolex:Element </h3>

	  	<p>
		We consider all <em>lemon</em> core concepts as being countable, annotatable/attestable and suitable for a numerical representation by means of a vector (embedding). For this reason, we define the rdfs:domain of all properties that link lexical and corpus information by means of ontolex:Element, an abstract superclass of 
		ontolex:Form (for word frequency and plain word/phrase embeddings),
		ontolex:LexicalEntry (for lemma frequency and lemma-based word/phrase embeddings), 
		ontolex:LexicalSense (for sense frequency and sense embeddings), and
		ontolex:LexicalConcept (for concept frequency and concept embeddings).

		Such a top-level concept used to exist in <em>Monnet-lemon</em>, but has been abandoned in the 2016 edition of <em>lemon</em>.
		If this concept is not provided by a future revision of the <em>lemon</em> core vocabulary, it will be introduced by this module.
		Note that the introduction of ontolex:Element has no effect on <em>lemon</em> core other that facilitating vocabulary organization, as ontolex:Element is not to be used for data modeling.</p></div>

	  <h3>Lexicographic Resource</h3>

	  
    There are certain situations (see [<cite><a href="#bib-bosque-module">10</a></cite>]) in which there is no one-to-one mapping between the entries in a dictionary, or lexicographical resource in general, and the lexical entries in a <i>lemon</i> lexicon (<tt>lime:Lexicon</tt>).

    For instance, some dictionary entries contain information about their translations and synonyms, but it may be the case that these latter do not have their own dictionary entry in the source dictionary. Still, such translations and synonyms can be treated as "first class citizens" in the graph by representing them as <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntr[ies]</tt>. In such situations, there is a disparity between the created <i>lime</i> lexicon and the original dictionary, as the linked data representation would include entries not encoded in the original resource as dictionary entries. For this reason, this is class is intended to represent the original lexicographic resource.

    <div class='entity'>
       <h3>Lexicographic Resource (Class)</h3>

    		</div>
    		<div class='comment'>

	  <p>A simple example of a lexicographic resource in English that collects several lexical entries is given below. While in this example <tt>:person_n</tt> and <tt>:animal_n</tt> are lexical entries compliant to the <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt> definition, a dictionary may provide only one single dictionary entry for the word <i>good</i>, compressing its noun, adjective and (colloquial) adverb definitions under one same structure. While the generated <tt>lime:Lexicon</tt> will contain entries with one single part of speech, following the <i>lemon</i> model, the <tt>lexicog:LexicographicResource</tt> instance will gather entities <i>as they were presented in the original lexicographic resource</i> in order to keep track of the of original representation in its RDF version:</p>

	  <div class='beispiel'>
		<p><a href='Examples/example1.png' class='tn'/><img src='Examples/example1.png'/></a></p>

	  <h3>Super Entry</h3>


    <p>The lack of a one-to-one mapping from a dictionary entry to a <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntry</tt> referred above often translates into a situation in which a structure in the original resource needs to be split into several <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntr[ies]</tt> for the resulting resource to be OntoLex-compliant. For example, we find this scenario in dictionaries that do not make a dictionary entry split in terms of the part-of-speech of a word. In these resources, the senses of a (polysemous) word are bundled together under the same dictionary entry even though they depend on different parts-of-speech. In these cases, these may be given as annotations just before the sense, e.g. <i>(n.)</i>, especially in non-digitally born resources. We can find this configuration also in dictionary entries that take different parts of speech depending on its syntactic behavior (e.g. adjective and adverb) without meaning change. </p>

    <p>In addition to bundling together lexical entries with different parts of speech, an entry in a lexicographic resource can also be composed of other (sub-)structures arranged in a particular order or hierarchy, such as senses, nested entries, etc. </p>

    <p><tt>lexicog:SuperEntry</tt> is introduced to represent the entry as it is encoded in a lexicographic resource, e.g. a dictionary entry, thereby reflecting the arrangement decided upon by lexicographers (supported by the occurrences of the word in the corpus used for dictionary compilation). This class is thus intended to be the counterpart of a dictionary entry in the linked data representation of a dictionary.</p>

      <h3>SuperEntryComponent</h3>

      <p>SuperEntry is intended to fulfill a structural function so as to serve as counterpart of a lexicographic record in a resource, which may or may not be straightly mapped into <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntries</tt>. However, these lexicographic records often contain sub-structures to refer to senses, sense groups, or nested entries. In an analogy to <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/csvw"> W3C's CSVW vocabulary </a>, where a <tt>csvw:Table</tt> consists of <tt>csvw:Row(s)</tt> and <tt>csvw:Column(s)</tt>, we can state that <tt>lexicog:SuperEntry</tt> also contains structural components, namely, <tt>lexicog:SuperEntryComponents</tt>. These components can refer to <tt>ontolex:LexicalSenses</tt> or <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntries</tt>, depending on the arrangement in the lexicographic resource. Components can in turn be arranged in a specific order and/or hierarchy, if desired, or just declared to be part of a <tt>lexicog:SuperEntry</tt>. <p>

        <p>A <strong>super entry component</strong> is a structural element that represents the (sub-)structures of lexicographic articles providing information about senses or sub-entries. If desired, SuperEntryComponents can be arranged in a specific ordered and/or a hierarchy. </p>

      <p>Coming back to the previous example, a lexicographic record for the word <i>animal</i> can group (under the same dictionary entry) descriptions for the lexical entries <i>animal</i> (n.), and <i>animal</i> (adj.), which both share phonetic representation and etymology. The following example is extracted from the American Heritage Dictionary [<cite><a href="#american-heritage-dictionary">16</a></cite>]:<p>


<blockquote cite="https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=animal">
<strong>an·i·mal</strong>
 <p>n.
 <p>
1. Any of numerous multicellular eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Metazoa (or Animalia) [...]  </p>
<p>
2. An animal organism other than a human, especially a mammal.
</p>
[...]
<p>
<p>
adj.
<p>
1. Relating to, characteristic of, or derived from an animal or animals, especially when not human: animal cells; animal welfare.</p>
<p>
2. Relating to the physical as distinct from the rational or spiritual nature of people: animal instincts and desires.</p>
<p>
</blockquote>

Here we can detect two different <tt>ontolex:LexicalEntries</tt> grouped together in the same lexicographic record, each with a sense ordering.  If this exact lexicographic record were to be recreated with the <i>lexicog</i> vocabulary, we would have the following RDF triples:

 <div class='beispiel'>
		<p><a href='Examples/example1.png' class='tn'/><img src='Examples/example1.png'/></a></p>
		<div>
		<pre><code>
      :animal_n a ontolex:LexicalEntry .
      :animal_adj ontolex:LexicalEntry.
      :animal_n_adj a lexicog:SuperEntry.

      :myDictionary a lexicog:LexicographicResource ;
	 dct:language &quot;en&quot; ;
         lexicog:superEntry :animal_n_adj.
      :myLexicon a lime:Lexicon;
         lime:entry :animal_n, :animal_adj.

      :animal_n_adj a lexicog:SuperEntry ;
         rdfs:member :animal_n_comp; :animal_adj_comp.

      :animal_n_comp a lexicog:SuperEntryComponent;
         lexicog:describes :animal_n .
      :animal_adj_comp a lexicog:SuperEntryComponent;
         lexicog:describes :animal_adj.

    </code></pre>
		</div>
	  </div>

<div class="note"><p>
	Note that this only states that there is a structure (SuperEntry) which contains sub-structures (components) which describe lexical elements, in this case, lexical entries.  If a dictionary describes <i>animal </i>(adj.) and <i>animal</i> (n.) in different records or if this exact arrangement is not to be transfered to the RDF representation, this approach would not be necessary.
</p></div>

This same approach can be applied to capture the sense order in the previous example:

In the dictionary entry, other dictionaries provide an ordered list of senses without any explicit sub-entry division per part-of-speech beyond an annotation at the sense level. E.g. the Spanish dictionary <i>Diccionario de la Lengua Epañola</i> lists all the senses of the word <i>blanco</i>, 'white' (adj.), 'gap, target, (mus.) half note'(n.). under the same dictionary entry, in an ordered list. In these cases, <tt>lexicog:SuperEntryComponents</tt> can be used to describe <tt>ontolex:LexicalSenses</tt>, and then in turn be arranged in the order given in the lexicographical article:

<div class='beispiel'>
		<p><a href='Examples/example1.png' class='tn'/><img src='Examples/example1.png'/></a></p>
		<div>
		<pre><code>

    <h3>describes</h3>

    Since <tt>lexicog:SuperEntryComponents</tt> fulfill a structural function to reflect the arrangment of the descriptions provided in a lexicographic resource (order, hierarchy, grouping, etc.), they do not encode lexical content themselves. This is accounted for by OntoLex elements, which are <i>decribed</i> by the components. This is grounded on the idea that a lexicographic resource describes the lexicon of a language (set of languages, dialect, field of study, etc.) following different criteria, e.g. the intended use of the resource, lexicographic tradition, etc. which can affect the description of the lexical content, leading to, for instance, two different resources describing the same lexicon differently.

    The property <tt>lexicog:describes</tt> allows to link components to the Ontolex core elements that encode lexical data:

<div id="describes" class="entity">
<h3 id="subterm-object-property">Describes (Object Property)<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#describes-object-property"></a></h3>

    <h3>FormRestriction</h3>

    There are numerous cases in which a lexicographic record specifies the grammatical features the lemma shows when used in some of its senses. For example, in English, the lemmas <i>good</i>, <i>manner</i>,  <i>air</i> or <i>wood</i> have senses which are usually (or only) attested when the word is used in plural, often indicated with the lemma in plural form, or with an usage note in the dictionary entry. [<cite><a href="#OED-dict-air">17</a></cite>]


<blockquote cite="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/air">
<strong>air</strong>
 <p>n. [...]
 <p>
2. An impression of a quality or manner given by someone or something. [...]
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
   2.1 <strong>(airs)</strong> An annoyingly affected and condescending manner.
</p>
[...]

</blockquote>


<p>
    While there are plural nouns which only occur in plural form (e.g. <i>ammends</i>, <i>scissors</i>), the so-called <i>pluralia tantum</i>, and they are usually defined in their own dictionary entry, there is also some variance across lexicographic resources in cases in which the noun also occurs in singular form. For instance, see <i>glassses</i> in the Oxford Dictionaries, in an entry separate from <i>glass</i>, as opposed to its treatment as a sub-sense of a sense of the lemma <i>glass</i> in the Merriam Webster Dictionary, with the annotation  "<i><strong>glasses</strong> plural</i>"). [TO-DO: INSERT LINKS]

</p>

<p>
There are dictionaries which provide grammatical annotations indicating varying gender in the senses of the same dictionary entry. For example, in Spanish, the lemma <i>policía</i> can be used in feminine or masculine if denoting a police officer, but only in feminine when denoting the police force or administration. Depending on the criteria followed for headword selection during the compilation of the resource, e.g. etymology, in these cases we may find two independent entries or one single entry with senses with different gender restrictions.

</p>

The <tt>lexicog:FormRestriction</tt> class is intended to provide a way to specify, from an external catalogue of linguitic data categories, the required (set of) grammatical features of a lemma when used in a specific <tt>ontolex:LexicalSense</tt>.


     <div class='entity'>

The following example is the RDF representation of the above mentioned sense of "air".

  <h3>UsageExample</h3>

There are occasions in lexicographic recodrs also include example of use of an entry in each of its senses. While these examples can be captured as <tt>skos:examples</tt> of <tt>ontolex:LexicalConcept(s)</tt>, sometimes there is more information about the example beyond the text itself. For instance, a bilingual dictionary such as Word Reference can include, for a sense, a usage example and a translation of the usage example in the target language:


<blockquote cite="https://www.wordreference.com/es/translation.asp?tranword=monastery">
 <p> <strong>monastery</strong> n (monk's residence) [English]  monasterio nm [Spanish]
 <p style="margin-left: 40px">
<i>We visited a Buddhist monastery deep in a jungle.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<i>Visitamos un monasterio budista en medio de la selva.</i>
</p>
<p> <strong>monastery</strong> n (community of monks) [English]	congregación nf [Spanish]
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<i>Most English monasteries were dissolved by King Henry VIII.</i>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
<i>La mayoría de los monasterios ingleses fueron disueltos por el rey Henry VIII.</i>
</p>

</blockquote>

The class <tt>lexicog:example</tt> is intentended to represent a single example as a resouce in order to be able to link it to any other information related to it provided in the lexicographic resource, from translations to usage notes:
